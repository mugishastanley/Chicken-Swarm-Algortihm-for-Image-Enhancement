# Chicken-Swarm-Algortihm-for-Image-Enhancement
Chicken swarm optimization is a new meta-heuristic algorithm which mimics the foraging hierarchical behavior of chicken. 
This project describes the contrast enhancement of digital images using the chicken swarm optmization algorithm.

#The paper explaining the algorithm has been added. ISCO pdf
